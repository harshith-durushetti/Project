VIRTUAL DRAWING USING OPENCV
  
The main purpose of our project Virtual Drawing using using OpenCV in AIML is We know that during the time covid-19 pandemic online learning has become very important and this technique is widely used all over the world. But there are many limitations for Online learning . One of the most important
limitation is concentrating on the line which is taught. It is also important that the Teachers to mark the important words or lines .So by using AIML algorithms a virtual marker is created which when pointing on a
important word are marked or underlined.
Virtual drawing : Basic idea of virtual drawing is to draw something in the air before camera that will be displayed on the screen.
OpenCV: It is a open source computer vision algorithm for capturing and displaying our required content on the computer screen window. So, OpenCV is an important algorithm for the project implementation.
Mediapipe: It is a design framework developed by google which is very much usefull for hand detection . In our project hand detection plays an important role because our fingers acts as virtual pen.
Numpy: It is generally defined as the numerical python shortly called as Numpy. which stores our output because using OpenCV and mediapipe we get output but it is not displayed on the screen so our Numpy plays an important role in displaying our output.
The software application for Virtual drawing using OpenCV in AIML will offer the following key product features:
Hand Tracking :
User can further develop this project or create new projects with the hand tracking module available the source code.
Image Drawing:
The focus is on detecting the whole hand first then the segmentation of the region is done. Region segmentation is a two step approach that has skin segmentation and background subtraction. Faster R-CNN is used for background subtraction. Centre if gravity is determined as it helps in detecting proper hand gesture. The proposed system aims to use two algorithms for centroid calculation and then take the average value of both as the final result. Distance transformation is the algorithm used and the pixel with the highest intensity is the centre of gravity.
